Once you have merged the pull requests from someone else in class, you need to find someone new in class to submit a pull request called "merge my list". that asks to merge your master into their master, so that they can add new items to their list and increment the duplicate issue count for each item in the list. Create an issue using the template "Assignment Master List" and reference the pull request that you make in the issue.
