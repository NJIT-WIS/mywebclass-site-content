# MyWebClass Collaboration and Brainstorming Assignment

## Overview

The purpose of this assignment is to practice collaborating using GIT/GitHub and develop the requirements for the mywebclass.org website's tutorials and courses.  To accomplish this task we are going to create three lists(What I Know, What I Don't Know, and What I Want To Learn) and consolidate the items from everyone in the class into a master list that counts the number of repeated issues.  You need at least **3 items for each list for a total of 9 items** and you should plan that these items are going to be used for project 1 as the basis for the possible topics that people can choose to build online tutorials about.   

## Learning Objectives:
1.  You will learn to collaborate online using GIT
2.  You will learn to merge pull requests and resolve merge conflicts
3.  You will learn to manage a basic project using GitHub Project.
